# core-architecture Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change refactor-architecture. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Modular Core Logic
The application logic MUST be split into single-responsibility modules rather than a monolithic `processor.py` file.
#### Scenario: Downloading a single file
Given the user requests to download a single file
When the CLI delegates the command
Then the `client.py` handles the Yandex API session
And the `downloader.py` handles the physical file streaming and progress bar.

### Requirement: Safe File Streaming
Downloads MUST write to a temporary `.part` file until fully downloaded to prevent corrupted files on interruption.
#### Scenario: Interrupted download
Given a file is mid-download
When the process is interrupted or fails
Then the partial file remains as `<filename>.part` and is not mistaken for a completed download.
